## Research Question 

○ What do you want to study? 

Beethoven (1770-1827) first mentioned hearing loss in a letter to Dr. Franz Wegler dated June 29, 1801: "In the past three years, my hearing has been gradually weaker. I can give you some idea of this peculiar deafness when I must tell you that in the theatre I have to get very close to the orchestra to understand the performers and that from a distance I do not hear the high notes of the instruments and the singers’ voices. . .Sometimes too I hardly hear people who speak softly. The sound I can hear is true, but not the words. And yet if anyone shouts I can’t bear it.” (Saccenti, 2011). The following is more detailed information about his deafness: the left ear was affected first, and he was reported (bilateral) tinnitus, and Poor speech discrimination is associated with high-pitched hearing loss and loud recruitment. Stevens KM reports that people had to shout to make themselves understood (1970). In 1818, Beethoven began to communicate using notebooks. There was no report that he could still understand oral conversations after 1825, so we assume his deafness was almost complete by then (Ealy GT, 1994). As his hearing got worse, Saccenti points out that he favoured lower and middle-range notes in his music in the British Medical Journal (2011). So we want to study if there is any difference in distribution of lower and middle-range notes, between his pre-deafness period (1770-1801) and post-deafness period (1801-1827); and how does the note distribution of Beethoven's music change during the process of his gradual deafness (1801-1827).

○ What is the larger context of your project? 

Beethoven’ s music composing is always divided into 3 stages (Von Lenz W, 2010). And in these two division methods, it is widely accepted that there was a style changing process when he lost the ability of hearing. And realising the fact is always considered as a milestone between the second and third stage (regarding the 4 stages division method).

○ Why is it interesting (for you)? 

Beethoven is one of the most famous musicians all over the world. Hearing ability is very important to a musician because music always interacts with people through ears. Musicians need to listen to their music to appreciate it and think about how to modify and improve it. So we wonder how  Beethoven adjusted his composing style to his increasingly weak ability of hearing. Because of our limited background on music appreciation, we would like to focus more on technical aspects and to base on some data analysis methods to find out the difference.

○ What are possible outcomes?

We have find some information on the Wikipedia that after deafness, Beethoven tended to use low or medium notes in his work to better understand his work at the initial phase of realising he is losing the ability of hearing. But when he became totally deaf, he no longer limited his use of notes any more. He did not try to compose music he can listen to. He gradually returned to his initial composing style.

## Concepts and Data 
 
○ What is the concrete focus of your project? 

We plan to focus on the major differences between the music Beethoven made before and after his deafness in the view of various music materials that taught in class. 

○ Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study? 

1) We’ll start from notes and analyze some statistics criterions for music in both periods. For example, we assume that pitches should be the most different material after the deafness because of human perception. 
2) Note combinations. Some notes can be far more frequently used than others, we think Beethoven might borrow some combinations from his previous works to replicate the wanted atmosphere. 
3) Chords and the progression of chords. We wonder how the chords cooperate with each other and the progressive relationships among multiple chords.

○ Which datasets can help you answer your research question?

## Methods

○ Which methods are you planning to use? 

We need to sort Beethoven's works according to the timeline, and analyze the distribution and transformation of different nodes, node combination, and Chords in different timeline works.

○ How are they related to the research question? 

By analyzing the changes in the distribution of Beethoven’s works in different timelines, and combining with the specific period of Beethoven’s deafness, we can see whether Beethoven’s work style has changed with the development of Beethoven’s deafness, and whether it will appear the change as mentioned in our hypothesis.

## Two more things 

○ For which part of your project do you need input and/or support from our side?

Are there any new dimensions for comparing Beethoven's music style before and after his illness?

○ You could already have a look into datasets suitable for you project

We are going to use Beethoven’s midi data to do the data analysis http://www.kunstderfuge.com/beethoven.htm.
