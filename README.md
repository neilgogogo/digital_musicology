## Research Question 

○ What do you want to study? 

Beethoven (1770-1827) first mentioned hearing loss in a letter to Dr. Franz Wegler dated June 29, 1801: "In the past three years, my hearing has been gradually weaker. I can give you some idea of this peculiar deafness when I must tell you that in the theatre I have to get very close to the orchestra to understand the performers and that from a distance I do not hear the high notes of the instruments and the singers’ voices. . .Sometimes too I hardly hear people who speak softly. The sound I can hear is true, but not the words. And yet if anyone shouts I can’t bear it.” (Saccenti, 2011). The following is more detailed information about his deafness: the left ear was affected first, and he was reported (bilateral) tinnitus, and Poor speech discrimination is associated with high-pitched hearing loss and loud recruitment. Stevens KM reports that people had to shout to make themselves understood (1970). In 1818, Beethoven began to communicate using notebooks. There was no report that he could still understand oral conversations after 1825, so we assume his deafness was almost complete by then (Ealy GT, 1994). As his hearing got worse, Saccenti points out that he favoured lower and middle-range notes in his music in the British Medical Journal (2011). So we want to study if there is any difference in distribution of lower and middle-range notes, between his pre-deafness period (1770-1801) and post-deafness period (1801-1827); and how does the note distribution of Beethoven's music change during the process of his gradual deafness (1801-1827).

○ What is the larger context of your project? 

Based on the previous discussion, Beethoven’ s music composing is often divided into 3 stages (Von Lenz W, 2010). The period of Beethoven's composing (the so-called three styles) corresponds to the developmental stage of his deafness (Saccenti, 2011). Although the correlation does not imply causality, it could still be reliable remarks for dividing his career life. So we will only use his deafness as milestones to mark the boundaries of his creative career. 

○ Why is it interesting (for you)? 

Beethoven is one of the most famous musicians all over the world. In most cases, musicians need to listen to their music to appreciate it and think about how to improve it. But as for Beethoven, he was hearing the music he composed internally and feeling it with his fingerings as interpretive clues after deafness (Newman, 1982). So this could be another perspective to distinguish composition styles in different periods. We wonder how Beethoven’s composing style changed with his increasingly weak ability of hearing. Also, we would like to focus more on technical aspects and to base on some data analysis methods to find out the difference, rather than the causality between his deafness and composition styles.


○ What are possible outcomes?

From Saccenti’s study, we know that after deafness, Beethoven tended to use low or medium notes in his work (2011), which is possible to  better understand his work at the initial phase of realising he is losing the ability of hearing. We also hypothesize that when he became totally deaf after 1825, he no longer limited his use of notes any more. He did not try to compose music he can listen to. He gradually returned to his initial composing style.

## Concepts and Data 
 
○ What is the concrete focus of your project? 

We plan to focus on the major differences between the music Beethoven made before and after his deafness in the view of various music materials that taught in class. 

○ Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study? 

1)We’ll start from notes and analyze some other statistics criterions for music. In these three periods, we’ll compare the frequencies of different notes to find out the notes that were used most and used least, analyzing if the distribution of notes over periods changed a lot. Besides, we assume that pitches should be the most different material after Bethoveen’s deafness because of human perception. Quantitative analysis for pitch classes should also be a significant indicator for the Bethoveen’s style among these periods.
 
2)Chord distribution. We plan to regard notes in different octaves as the same note to reduce the scale of chord amount. In this way, some chords can be used very rarely, while some can be far more frequently used than others. We are going to figure out whether there are high density regions in the chords distribution. If there are, we will dive into different periods and look into the dissonance and consonance of high-frequent chords.
 
3)The combinations of chords. We expect to analyze the chord progression using n-grams only from the view of pitch-class sets. Similarly, to reduce the complexity of this question, we will only focus on high-frequent progressions in 2-grams and 3-grams characterize the styles in different periods.
We also think Beethoven might borrow some chords and chord permutations from his previous works to replicate the expected effects. That is to say, did he still continuously use new materials or tend to borrow them from previous work?

## Methods

○ Which methods are you planning to use? 

We need to sort Beethoven's works according to the timeline, and analyze the distribution and transformation of different nodes and pitches, chord distribution, and chord progression in different timeline works. 
For the first two questions, quantitative statistics can be enough to draw valid conclusions. As for the chord progression, we are planning to adopt the n-grams method. 


○ How are they related to the research question? 

We divide Beethoven’s creative career into three different periods according to the development of his deafness, and try to characterize the transformations of his composition style by some basic music materials. By analyzing the changes in the distribution of Beethoven’s works in different periods, we can see whether Beethoven’s work style has changed and whether it will confirm the assumptions as mentioned in previous sections. 
Because the causations of such transformations could be tangled, we only use his deafness as milestones to mark the boundaries of his creative career. As for the correlation between his deafness and style changes, it can require further experiments and analysis.

## Two more things 

○ For which part of your project do you need input and/or support from our side?

Not yet.

○ You could already have a look into datasets suitable for you project

We are going to use Beethoven’s midi data to do the data analysis http://www.kunstderfuge.com/beethoven.htm.
