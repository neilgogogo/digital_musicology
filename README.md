## milestone 0
For milestone 0, you have to write a short project proposal (ca. 500-700 words) that answers the following questions:

## Research Question 
○ What do you want to study? 

We want to study whether there is an obvious difference between the music Beethoven made before and after his deafness? And how did his music change during the process of his gradual deafness?

○ What is the larger context of your project? 

Beethoven’ s music composing is always divided into 3 or 4 stages. And in these two division methods, it is widely accepted that there was a style change process when he lost the ability of hearing. And realising the fact is always considered as a milestone between the second and third stage (regarding the 4 stages division method).

○ Why is it interesting (for you)? 

Beethoven is one of the most famous musicians all over the world. Hearing is very important to a musician, because music always interacts with people through ears. Musicians need to listen to their music to appreciate it and think how to modify and improve it. So we wonder how  Beethoven adjusted his composing style to his increasingly weak ability of hearing. Because we are all not very good at music appreciation, we would like to focus more on technical aspects and based on some data analysis methods to find out the difference.

○ What are possible outcomes?

We have find some information on the Wikipedia that after deafness, Beethoven tended to use low or medium notes in his work to better understand his work at the start of realising he is losing the ability of hearing. But when he became totally deaf, he never limited his use of notes. He did not try to compose music he can listen to. He gradually returned to his initial composing style.

## Concepts and Data 
 
○ What is the concrete focus of your project? 

We plan to focus on the major differences between the music Beethoven made before and after his deafness in the view of various music materials that taught in class. 

○ Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study? 

1) We’ll start from notes and analyze some statistics criterions for music in both periods. For example, we assume that pitches should be the most different material after the deafness because of human perception. 
2) Note combinations. Some notes can be far more frequently used than others, we think Beethoven might borrow some combinations from his previous works to replicate the wanted atmosphere. 
3) Chords and the progression of chords. We wonder how the chords cooperate with each other and the progressive relationships among multiple chords.

○ Which datasets can help you answer your research question?

## Methods

○ Which methods are you planning to use? 

We need to sort Beethoven's works according to the timeline, and analyze the distribution and transformation of tones, timbres, and noses in different timeline works.

○ How are they related to the research question? 

By analyzing the changes in the distribution of Beethoven’s works in different timelines, and combining with the specific period of Beethoven’s deafness, we can see whether Beethoven’s work style has changed with the development of Beethoven’s deafness, and whether it will appear the change as mentioned in our hypothesis.

## Literature 

○ What is the state-of-the-art in relation to your question? Name at least 3 relevant publications.

○ Which issues are not yet addressed that your project supplements?
 
## Two more things 

○ For which part of your project do you need input and/or support from our side?

○ You could already have a look into datasets suitable for you project

We are going to use Beethoven’s midi data to do the data analysis http://www.kunstderfuge.com/beethoven.htm.
